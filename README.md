This is a weather web app that provides real-time weather updates for a user-specified location. Users can search for weather information by city name or zip code. The app displays current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, as well as a 5-day forecast. 
The app also includes interactive maps and charts to visualize weather data. Users can create an account to save their favorite locations and set up alerts for severe weather conditions. The app is built using modern web technologies and is responsive, making it accessible on all devices

In the project, there is use of GeoDb Cities API from rapid API.
For the weather information used, Open Weather API was the best fit. 

// Currently under development with regular updates.
//working on the bug that prevents the app to display data.
//The issue started when I intergrated the function to disable sharing of API keys


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
