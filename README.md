This is a weather web app that provides real-time weather updates for a user-specified location. Users can search for weather information by city name or zip code. The app displays current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, as well as a 5-day forecast. 


In the project, there is use of GeoDb Cities API from rapid API.
For the weather information used, Open Weather API was the best fit. 

// Currently under development with regular updates.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
